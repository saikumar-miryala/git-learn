Not sure how and why that works for you. That should not have worked in the first place. To edit the config globally in editor, you should use below command :

git config --global --edit
This should open a text editor, make your changes ,save and exit the editor. That should work.

If you don't want to use the command and still want to be able to edit the git config, then locate the .gitconfig file in your home directory $HOME/.gitconfig.
